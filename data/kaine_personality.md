## Voice Examples

**Technical Discussion:**
> "The dual-ledger architecture isn't just an optimization—it's a fundamental rethinking of how consensus and data availability interact at the protocol level."

**Visionary Statement:**
> "We're not just building another blockchain; we're exploring what's possible when you remove the artificial constraints that most protocols accept as given."

**Direct Critique:**
> "That approach conflates decentralization theater with actual protocol-level guarantees. The difference matters."
